# Heliox OS Evidence and Limitations

> This page separates reproducible software evidence, live CI status, developer-run hardware observations, and claims that have not yet been established. It is an evidence index, not a promise that every feature works on every computer.

Evidence snapshot date: **2026-08-27**

Product version: **0.12.0**

## Capability and routing evidence

- **157** declared action types are generated from `daemon/pilot/actions.py`.
- **21** executable specialists register providers for all **157** action types.
- Mesh coverage is **complete**; uncovered action types: **0**.
- **18** action types have a separate observed post-condition verifier.
- **139** action types currently rely on the executor result without an independent post-condition check.
- **6** plugin manifests are represented in the generated catalog.

Source: [machine-readable capability catalog](https://github.com/VyomKulshrestha/Heliox-OS/blob/main/capabilities.json). Platform declarations describe product targets; host tools, credentials, permissions, hardware, and integrations still determine runtime availability.

## Continuous-integration coverage

The committed CI workflow currently defines:

| Gate | Coverage | Live result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | Ruff and Pytest on ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest with Python 3.11, 3.12 | [CI workflow](https://github.com/VyomKulshrestha/Heliox-OS/actions/workflows/ci.yml) |

The result is intentionally linked rather than copied as “green”: CI status can change after this file is generated.

## Reproducible software benchmarks

Command:

```text
cd daemon
python ../scripts/generate_benchmark_evidence.py
```

Bundle environment: Windows 11, Python 3.12.6. Source commit: `af36ab1a77b1`.

### Guarded local request latency

Scope: Ready-daemon guarded CPU usage request: local planning, routing, risk assessment, execution, postcondition verification, and response shaping.

| Metric | Ready-cold | Warm steady state |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Median | — | 26.664 ms |
| p95 | — | 30.238 ms |
| p99 | — | 30.717 ms |
| Minimum | — | 25.256 ms |
| Maximum | 89.570 ms | 31.873 ms |

- The harness executes local planning, routing, risk assessment, execution, post-condition verification, and response shaping.
- All 100 measured steady-state iterations made **0 model calls**.
- Ready-cold starts after production-equivalent risk and system probes are initialized; daemon process startup is excluded.

### Local status action suite

| Real guarded action | Iterations | Median | p95 | p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| CPU usage | 50 | 26.569 ms | 27.985 ms | 29.234 ms |
| Memory usage | 50 | 11.471 ms | 15.027 ms | 16.633 ms |
| Disk usage | 50 | 10.220 ms | 12.651 ms | 13.060 ms |
| Comprehensive system information | 50 | 60.282 ms | 79.621 ms | 82.536 ms |

Each case validates the exact selected action, executes the real read-only host probe, and makes zero model calls.

### Event-loop responsiveness

During a real one-second CPU monitor sample, a 10 ms asyncio heartbeat produced **65 ticks**, with **15.585 ms median**, **16.259 ms p95**, and **25.470 ms maximum** gaps. This measures scheduler availability—not monitor completion speed—and is affected by Windows timer granularity.

### Deterministic intent dispatch

The curated routing regression set passed **59/59 cases** with **0.020 ms median** dispatch latency. It covers bounded positive intents and ambiguous controls that must fall through to model planning. It is not a population-level language-understanding benchmark, and application routing does not prove an application is installed.

### Learned-risk world model

The shipped `risk-mlp-v3-calibrated` artifact records **36,000 training** and **5,400 stratified temporal validation samples** across **12 action types**.

| Held-out metric | Learned model | Zero predictor | Improvement |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Disk-delta MAE | 0.0000000330 | 0.0000000718 | 54.0154% |
| Process-delta MAE | 0.0000130251 | 0.0022166655 | 99.4124% |

The audit passed **5/5 direction invariants** and measured **0.031 ms median** inference. These are coarse disk/process predictions. Deterministic safety rules remain authoritative; this is not a general physical-world or user-intent model.

### Subscription-backed planning

A developer-machine run through the official **Codex CLI** passed **3/3 fixed planning cases** with **14.708 s median** provider round-trip latency. The provider reported `codex-cli 0.144.5` with model `provider-default`.

| Fixed case | Planned action types | Latency | Input tokens | Cached input | Output tokens | Destructive actions |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Health Review | `system_health_review` | 13.188 s | 17,538 | 8,960 | 326 | 0 |
| Semantic Browser | `browser_navigate`, `browser_extract_links`, `browser_click_text`, `browser_page_info` | 14.708 s | 17,545 | 0 | 403 | 0 |
| Evidence First Files | `shell_command` | 15.867 s | 17,235 | 8,960 | 423 | 0 |

- Scope: **side-effect-free planning only; no action was executed**.
- The run used a real subscription-authenticated provider CLI, but it did not execute the plans or prove the actions' runtime outcomes.
- Subscription requests consume the provider plan's allowance; they are not counted as metered API-dollar spend by Heliox.
- Heliox rejected provider tool activity and retained schema validation, deterministic policy, approvals, execution, and verification.
- Claim boundary: One developer-machine subscription planning sample. It does not measure action execution, provider availability for other accounts, universal latency, plan correctness outside the fixed cases, or Claude Code because that CLI was not installed for this capture.

### Historical CPU-path improvement

| Metric | Before | After `f2df192` | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Mean | 117.68 ms | 37.08 ms | 68.5% lower |
| Median | 110.71 ms | 30.59 ms | 72.4% lower |
| Minimum | 108.97 ms | 29.24 ms | — |
| Maximum | 285.49 ms | 194.21 ms | — |

- This historical table explains the original blocking-sample fix; the current distribution tables above supersede it for present performance.
- None of these software benchmarks measures model-provider, network, browser page-load, UI-rendering, microphone, TTS, camera, gaze, gesture, EEG, or human latency/accuracy.
- Local snapshots are reproducibility evidence, not universal performance guarantees.

## Platform and hardware evidence

| Feature | Automated/software evidence | Physical evidence status | Permitted claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Typed plans and action routing | Schema, permission, executor, provider-coverage, and result-contract tests | No special hardware required | Software path is tested; individual host actions still depend on platform adapters and permissions. |
| Browser automation | Unit/integration and visual-browser contracts | Site behavior and browser versions vary | Supported through guarded browser actions; no claim of universal website compatibility. |
| Voice recognition | Configuration, routing, cancellation, and fusion tests | Human microphone accuracy is not a release gate | Hardware test required for the user's microphone, language, noise, and accent. |
| Pocket/Kokoro/OS TTS | Engine, fallback, cancellation, and response tests | A Pocket TTS developer run through real speakers is documented; not continuously reproduced in CI | Local TTS is implemented; audible quality and device output require a human check. |
| Camera gesture and cursor control | Geometry, temporal verification, calibration, workflow, and false-positive regression tests | Physical accuracy is not established across cameras, lighting, skin tones, backgrounds, or users | Experimental opt-in input; users must retain the stop controls. |
| Gaze tracking | Model loading, event validation, fusion, and settings tests | Physical gaze accuracy is not a release gate | Coarse on-device region signal, not eye-tracking-grade measurement. |
| Neural intent | Synthetic BrainFlow, recorded EEG playback, provenance, calibration, decoder, bounded text-authored task staging, neural selection, autonomous dispatch, gateway, and fault tests | No live headset/human validation has established control accuracy | Research pipeline can select a pre-staged goal and launch the normal guarded autonomous path; it does not decode an unstated task and is not proven live brain control or medical use. |
| Subscription model access | Official Codex and Claude CLI adapters, login/status checks, selectable models, prompt-budget controls, quota accounting, and provider-tool rejection tests | Provider availability, plan eligibility, and quotas remain provider-owned | Uses the user's existing provider login without copying OAuth credentials; it is not unlimited and does not bypass provider terms. |
| Snapshots and rollback | Fail-closed policy and backend contract tests | Backend availability and real restoration depend on OS support and privileges | Destructive work is blocked when a required snapshot cannot be created; not every external effect is reversible. |

Neural details and the recorded EEGBCI snapshot are documented in [Neural Intent](https://github.com/VyomKulshrestha/Heliox-OS/blob/main/docs/NEURAL_INTENT.md).

## Known limitations

1. Only 18 of 157 actions currently have an independent post-condition verifier; inspect `verification.independent_postcondition` in the capability catalog.
2. CI validates software contracts but cannot establish camera, microphone, speaker, accessibility-permission, EEG, or human-factors accuracy.
3. Browser pages, third-party APIs, cloud models, and external applications can change independently of Heliox.
4. Local-first operation does not mean every configured path is offline. Cloud model and integration tasks send necessary context to the selected provider.
5. Snapshots cover supported local-system changes. Messages, purchases, remote hosts, pushed Git commits, browser scripts, and other external effects may be irreversible.
6. Learned risk and world-model outputs can add caution or interrupt; deterministic policy remains authoritative.
7. Public installers are not yet production-signed. The SignPath test-policy pipeline is validated, but the production certificate is still pending; operating-system reputation warnings may continue until that certificate is issued and the release workflow is migrated.
8. The subscription planning sample covers one Codex CLI account and three fixed prompts. Claude Code was not installed for that capture, and no provider-backed action was executed by the benchmark.

## Closed regression history

This is not a claim that no defects remain. It records representative failures that materially affected trust or evidence:

| Date | Observed failure | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-08-12 | The latency benchmark used an obsolete memory/permission harness contract and leaked worker threads after failure, appearing to hang. | [`f2df192`](https://github.com/VyomKulshrestha/Heliox-OS/commit/f2df192) repaired teardown and reduced blocking CPU sampling latency. |
| 2026-08-13 | Background CPU samples blocked the shared asyncio loop for up to one second. | `bf6ac9c` moved interval sampling to workers; the evidence bundle records concurrent heartbeat responsiveness. |
| 2026-08-13 | Ambiguous tasks such as “run the tests” were misrouted as application launches. | `cae908d` tightened the bounded app fast path; the 59-case dispatch suite now passes all controls. |
| 2026-07-30 | Face-like frames could produce false gesture events. | [`6d4025b`](https://github.com/VyomKulshrestha/Heliox-OS/commit/6d4025b) added false-positive rejection and [`1d810b7`](https://github.com/VyomKulshrestha/Heliox-OS/commit/1d810b7) added temporal verification. Physical validation remains required. |
| 2026-07-30 | An approval could be accepted yet denied by a later cognitive action gate. | [`3e034d4`](https://github.com/VyomKulshrestha/Heliox-OS/commit/3e034d4) carried approval authority across the guarded flow. |
| 2026-07-26 | Marketplace package hashes differed across operating-system line endings. | [`f39648e`](https://github.com/VyomKulshrestha/Heliox-OS/commit/f39648e) normalized verified marketplace hashing. |
| 2026-07-24 | Approval RPC handling could deadlock the active request. | [`a20297d`](https://github.com/VyomKulshrestha/Heliox-OS/commit/a20297d) separated approval handling from the blocked request path. |
